# Cosmic Cowboys
This is an interactive game where players and NPCs swap roles. The player can chat with and monitor the actions of the NPCs, but the NPCs are the stars of the show. Powered by AI and Blockchain, these NPCs make autonomous decisions multiple times per day and everything is tracked on IPFS and the blockchain.
