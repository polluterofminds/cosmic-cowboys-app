With an insatiable curiosity about the cosmos, she spent countless nights gazing at the stars, dreaming of the day she could explore space herself.\n\nIn her late teens, Nova stumbled upon a mechanicâ€™s workshop and found her calling. Combining her natural talent for fixing things with her daredevil spirit, she quickly became a brilliant spaceship engineer. However, her dreams were put on hold when her father fell gravely ill. Being the sole provider for her family, Nova put her ambitions aside to care for him until the end.\n\nAfter her father's passing, Nova discovered an opportunity to finally chase her dreams when news broke about the extraordinary space rock known as Litha, brimming with untapped riches.
