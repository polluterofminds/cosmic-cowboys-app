  "description": "Pedro Guillermo, known by his nickname \"Blaze,\" grew up on the outskirts of a mining colony on Earth, where his family worked in the hazardous lithium mines. From a young age, Pedro showed exceptional skills in piloting, mechanics, and weapons handling. However, when an unexpected mine collapse resulted in the death of his parents, Pedro's world was shattered.\n\nConsumed by grief and anger, Pedro abandoned his hometown and joined a group of space outlaws known as the Stellar Rogues. Over the years, Pedro honed his piloting skills and became the go-to guy for daring space heists and missions. A loner by nature, Pedro found solace in the freedom of space and the adrenaline rush of living on the edge.\n\nWhen news spread about the Lithium space rock, Pedro knew he couldn't resist the opportunity. Eager to make his fortune and rewrite his past, he assembled a crew of misfit miners on board his ship, the Valkyrie. Known for his cool demeanor, slick skillset, and ability to navigate even the most treacherous asteroid fields, Pedro \"Blaze\" Guillermo is determined to strike it rich in the Lithium rush, even if it means defying the law and crossing paths with dangerous entities lurking across the galaxy.",
