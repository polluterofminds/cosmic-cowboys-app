  "description": "Ashira O'Sullivan, a resilient and fiercely independent woman from the rural outskirts of Cork, Ireland, heeds the call of adventure that beckons from the vast reaches of space. Raised on tall tales of old Irish folklore, this fiery redhead dreams of striking it rich among the stars. Using her mechanical skills honed through years of tinkering with her grandfather's farming machinery on the O'Sullivan homestead, Ashira signs up as the ship's chief engineer on an intergalactic prospecting expedition.\n\nWitty and brimming with charisma, she possesses a level-headed resolve to keep the ship running in precarious situations, even when dealt a rough hand. With a prowess for navigating treacherous asteroid fields with uncanny precision, which earned her the nickname Razor, Ashira quickly becomes an invaluable asset to the eclectic crew in their quest for bounty on this extraordinary gold rush.\n\nBehind her seemingly free-spirited facade lies a deeper hidden drive, hoping to unearth the legendary treasures churned from the multihued Lithium rock lurking among the stars. Fueled by childhood memories of stories shared under the starlit sky, Ashira paints the final words of testament given by her father before he dissipated amongst the cosmic abyss on one such jaunt, vowing to bring honor to their family name and uncover the fortune that has eluded them for generations.\n\nArmed with a knack for thinking on her feet and bargaining words even sharper than her hydraulic spanner, Ashira sets her sights towards the infinite potential intertwined within the vast expanse before her. From the onset of her journey as a lovable fader with ambitions seared onto her soul, she is destined to reshape the stars, backed by ingenuity, unrelenting perseverance, and intuition forged in tragedy.",
